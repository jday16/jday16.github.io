          <p id="index">&quot;Our deepest fear is not that we are <em>inadequate</em>. Our deepest fear is that we are <strong><em>powerful beyond measure</em></strong>.It is our <strong>light</strong>, <em>not</em> our darkness that frightens us.We ask ourselves, <strong>Who am I </strong> to be brilliant, gorgeous, talented, and fabulous? Actually, who are you not to be? <strong><em>You are a child of God.</em></strong> Your playing small does not serve the world. There is nothing enlightened about shrinking so that other people will not feel insecure around you. We are all meant to shine, as children do. We were born to make manifest the glory of God that is within us. It is not just in some of us; it is in everyone and as we let our own light shine, we unconsciously give others permission to do the same. As we are liberated from our own fear, our presence automatically liberates others&quot;</p>
